## Collaboration Agreement

**Logistical**
What hours will you be available to communicate?

- Class hours and off hours if more work needed.

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack, Discord, Phone.

How often will you take breaks?

- Every hour.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- Ask for help. Seek Instructor or TA's guidance.

**Cooperative**
Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

- Sydney: Flexibility and Creativity.

- Alejandra: Communication, Leadership, Adaptability, Problem Solving.

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

- Sydney: Embrace changes in requirements and feedback, iteratively refining the app's features. Tackle challenges creatively, considering multiple solutions that suit the app's goals.

- Alejandra: My strengths can help make sure we both are effectively contributing to the projects and making sure to accomplish daily goals and requirements.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Sydney: Work together to understand complex code snippets. Discuss concepts, share resources, and teach each other to reinforce understanding.

- Alejandra: I want to grow greater strength in understanding the systems and servers.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

- Sydney: Regularly review each other's code. Collaboratively write code in real-time.

- Alejandra: I plan to split work off between front and backend. And occassionally switch repos so we both can get a better understanding for the code.

**Conflict Resolution**
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

- Sydney: Reevaluate the distribution of tasks and responsibilities. Schedule regular check-in meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming tasks.

- Alejandra: We will effectively communicate with eachother how we can even the work load and dissect what everyone can contribute daily.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

- Sydney: Emphasize the importance of each team member's input and skills. Introduce a rotation system where both team members take turns leading different aspects of the project like the Driver-Navigator Collaboration.

- Alejandra: Communication is key if someone is not choosing to communicate we can have our instructor mediate and more effective plan for the team.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Sydney: Openly discussing our respective skill levels and areas of expertise. Align on the common goal and vision for the application. Approach the project as a learning journey.

- Alejandra: Communicating where we both don't fully understand something and seeing if we can teach eachother or learn together.
